# Installation 

## macOS

 1. Make sure "Allow user to administer this computer" in System Preferences → Users & Groups is checked for the current user
Get Homebrew (it will install macOS Command Line Tools, like Git, as well):

    ```
    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
    ```

 2. Get the dotfiles:
    ```
    ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts; git clone git@github.com:antoni/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
    ```

3. Install:
    ```
    ~/dotfiles/mac/install.sh
    ~/dotfiles/symlink.sh
    ~/dotfiles/mac/defaults.sh # Configure the system
    ```
